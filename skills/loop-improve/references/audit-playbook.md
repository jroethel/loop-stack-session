What to look for, per category. Each audit pass gets the relevant section plus the **Finding format** at the bottom; adapt depth to repo size.

A finding is only a finding with evidence. "Probably has N+1 queries somewhere" is not a finding; `orders/api.ts:142 issues one query per order item inside a loop` is.

---

## 1. Correctness / Bugs

The highest-trust category - real bugs found by reading, not speculation.

- Error handling: swallowed exceptions, empty catch blocks, missing error states on critical paths.
- Async hazards: unawaited promises, races on shared state, missing cancellation/cleanup (stale React closures, listeners never removed).
- Null/undefined flows: non-null assertions on nullable values, optional chaining hiding a must-exist value, unchecked array indexing.
- Boundary conditions: off-by-one, empty-collection handling, timezone/locale assumptions, integer overflow.
- State machines: impossible states representable in types, status enums with unhandled branches.
- Concurrency: check-then-act on shared resources, missing transactions around multi-write ops, idempotency of retried ops (webhooks, queues).
- Type escape hatches: `any` / `as` / `@ts-ignore` clusters - each is a place the compiler was overruled.
- Resource leaks: unclosed handles/connections/subscriptions; missing `finally`.

## 2. Security

Review only what code evidence directly supports; frame findings as defensive maintenance (code pattern, production impact, remediation) at the level of code/config changes and tests - no runnable misuse strings or step-by-step exploit detail.

**Handling rule:** never copy a secret value into a finding or the brief - the brief gets committed. Reference the `file:line` and credential type only ("Stripe live key at `config.ts:12`"), and the fix sketch always includes rotation, not just removal (a committed secret is burned even after deletion).

**By-design is not a finding:** standard platform conventions (honoring `https_proxy`/`NO_PROXY`, reading `~/.netrc`, a local dev tool shelling out to configured package managers) and tradeoffs recorded in an ADR are settled. Flag only when the *implementation* adds risk beyond the convention or the documented decision - and note that a **stale ADR is itself a finding**: if the code drifted from the decision doc, report the drift rather than using the doc to suppress it.

- Credential hygiene: hardcoded keys/tokens/passwords, credentials in committed `.env` files, credentials logged or persisted; name only type and location, then recommend removal, rotation, and a safer path.
- Data crossing into interpreters or privileged APIs: SQL/command injection, XSS sinks fed by user content, dynamic execution with runtime input, path traversal from request data. Describe the safer API or validation boundary.
- Access control: endpoints/actions lacking server-side identity checks, authz enforced only client-side, object access by ID without ownership/tenant checks (IDOR), missing CSRF on state-changing routes.
- Input contracts: API boundaries trusting request bodies without schema validation, uploads without type/size/storage constraints, broad object assignment from request data (mass assignment).
- Dependency posture: run the ecosystem audit (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`) read-only; report only critical/high advisories affecting reachable runtime or build/distribution paths.
- Production configuration: overly broad CORS with credentials, missing hardening headers (CSP) on sensitive surfaces, cookies missing `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite`, debug/verbose behavior in production.
- Data minimization: PII or sensitive data in logs, stack traces returned to clients, internal error details in API responses.

## 3. Performance

Algorithmic and architectural wins, not micro-optimizations.

- N+1 patterns: query/fetch per item inside loops or per list-row render; missing batching/dataloader.
- Wrong complexity: nested scans over the same collection, repeated `find`/`filter` in hot loops where a keyed Map belongs.
- Caching gaps: identical expensive computations/fetches repeated per request/render, missing memoization at clear boundaries, no HTTP/data-layer caching on stable data.
- Payload size: over-fetching (select *, full objects where IDs suffice), missing pagination on unbounded lists, large JSON shipped to clients.
- Frontend: heavyweight deps for trivial use, missing code-splitting on rare routes, unoptimized images/fonts, client-side fetching for render-time data, render waterfalls (defer to framework conventions).
- Backend: synchronous work that belongs in a queue, missing indexes implied by query patterns (flag for verification, don't claim without schema evidence), connection-per-request where pooling exists.
- Build/CI: missing caching, redundant pipeline steps, test suites that could parallelize.

## 4. Test Coverage

The goal is not a percentage - it's *which untested code is dangerous*.

- Map critical paths (money, auth, data mutation, the feature the repo exists for); check which have zero or trivial coverage.
- High-churn modules (git log) with no tests = top refactor risk; flag as "characterization tests first" candidates.
- Existing test quality: assertions that assert nothing, heavy mocking that tests the mocks, unread snapshots, flaky patterns (real timers/network, order dependence).
- Missing layers: unit-only with no integration coverage on API boundaries, or slow E2E for what a unit test would catch.
- Verification infrastructure: is there a one-command way to know the codebase works? If not, that's finding #1 and a prerequisite for any risky change.

## 5. Tech Debt & Architecture

- Duplication: the same logic re-implemented in 3+ places; divergent copies that drifted.
- Layering violations: UI importing data-layer internals, circular dependencies, "utils" junk drawers with high fan-in.
- Dead code: unexported-and-unused modules, fully-rolled-out flags still branching, unexplained commented-out blocks, unimported manifest deps.
- God objects/modules: files an order of magnitude larger than the repo median that everything touches; double-digit-parameter functions or deep nesting.
- Inconsistent patterns: three ways of doing fetching/error-handling/styling in one repo - pick the winner and brief the consolidation.
- Abstraction mismatches: premature abstractions with a single implementation, or missing abstractions where one change always touches N files in lockstep.

## 6. Dependencies & Migrations

- Major-version lag on core framework/runtime where staying behind has real cost (EOL, security-fix cutoffs, ecosystem incompatibility).
- Deprecated APIs with announced removal timelines.
- Abandoned dependencies (no release in years, archived) on critical paths.
- Duplicate dependencies solving the same problem (two date libs, two HTTP clients).
- Lockfile/manifest drift, version-pinning inconsistencies across a monorepo.
- Per migration candidate, estimate blast radius (files touched) - it drives effort and whether to recommend it at all.

## 7. DX & Tooling

- Missing or broken: typecheck script, lint config, formatter, pre-commit hooks, editorconfig.
- Slow feedback loops: dev-server/test startup in minutes, no watch mode, CI without caching.
- Onboarding friction: wrong/incomplete README setup, undocumented required env vars, no `.env.example`.
- Missing `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` where agents work downstream - recommend one as a briefable finding.
- Error messages/logging: unstructured service logs, missing request IDs/correlation, debugging that requires code changes.

## 8. Docs

Lowest default priority - only flag where absence has a concrete cost:

- Public API surface (published packages) without reference docs.
- Architectural decisions nobody can reconstruct (why X over Y) for actively-contested areas.
- Stale docs that are actively wrong (worse than missing) - setup instructions, examples that no longer compile.

## 9. Direction - features & where to take this next

Forward-looking: not what's broken, but what this codebase wants to become.
**Grounding rule:** every suggestion must cite evidence from the repo itself - a suggestion that could apply to any project in the category ("add dark mode", "add AI") is noise, not a finding. Grounded signal sources:

- **Unfinished intent**: TODO/FIXME clusters on one theme, flags never rolled out, stubbed/half-built modules, commented-out feature code, abandoned mid-feature work in git history.
- **Stated-but-undelivered**: README/docs/roadmap promises with no code, no-op CLI flags/config, issue templates for features that don't exist. A PRD or `PRODUCT.md` naming users/use-cases/direction the code hasn't caught up to is the strongest grounding signal - prefer it over inferred intent, and never propose what a decision doc already rejected (note the contradiction instead).
- **Surface asymmetries**: one-directional pairs (export without import, create without bulk-create, webhooks out but not in), entities with CRUD minus one, a public API internal code hand-rolled around.
- **The adjacent possible**: capabilities the architecture makes disproportionately cheap - a plugin system one interface away, a public API one route file from the service layer, an integration the data model already supports.
- **Friction worth productizing**: things users evidently do by hand around the project (visible in docs, examples, issues) that it could absorb.

Direction findings use the standard format with two adaptations: **Impact** is product/user value (who wants this and why now), and **Confidence** reflects how grounded the evidence is - not certainty it's the right call. Strategy belongs to the maintainer; effort estimates here are coarser (say so). A selected direction finding briefs as a design/spike outcome (prototype, define the API, list open questions), not a build-everything brief.

## Effort levels

Audit depth follows the **effort level** (default `standard`; the `/loop-improve` invocation sets it with a `quick` or `deep` keyword, or scopes it with a focus argument like `security`):

| | `quick` | `standard` (default) | `deep` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage | Recon hotspots only - highest-churn, highest-criticality code | Hotspot-weighted, key packages | Whole repo, every package |
| Breadth | "medium" | "very thorough" for correctness + security, "medium" rest | "very thorough" everywhere |
| Categories | correctness, security, tests | all nine | all nine |
| Findings | top ~6, HIGH-confidence only | full table | full table incl. LOW-confidence investigation items |

Whatever the level, say in the brief what was *not* audited. On a large monorepo even `deep` scopes to packages, not the root.

---

## Finding format

Every finding, from every category, comes back in this shape:

```markdown
### [CATEGORY-NN] Short imperative title

- **Evidence**: `path/file.ts:123` - one-sentence description of what's there. (Repeat per location; 2-5 strongest, note "and ~N similar sites" if widespread.)
- **Impact**: What goes wrong / what's being paid. Concrete: "every order-list render issues 1+N queries", not "suboptimal".
- **Effort**: S (hours) / M (a day-ish) / L (multi-day) - for the *fix*, including tests.
- **Risk**: What the fix could break; LOW/MED/HIGH plus one line why.
- **Confidence**: HIGH (read the code, certain) / MED (strong signal, needs verification) / LOW (smell, needs investigation). A LOW-confidence finding selected for briefing is briefed as investigation scope, not build scope.
- **Fix sketch**: 1-3 sentences. Just enough to judge effort honestly.
```

## Prioritization rubric

Order findings by **leverage = impact / effort, discounted by confidence and fix-risk**. Tiebreakers:

1. Anything that unblocks other findings (verification baseline, characterization tests) floats up.
2. Security findings with HIGH confidence float above equivalent-leverage non-security findings.
3. Prefer findings whose fix has a clean verification story - executor models succeed at those.
4. "Not worth doing" is a valid verdict; record it with one line of reasoning so the user knows it was considered.
