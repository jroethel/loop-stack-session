# Tracker scan

Shared step for loop-brainstorm and loop-improve: check the thing in hand (a fresh idea, an audit
finding) against what is already tracked before spending further effort shaping it.

Make one call to `scripts/tracker.sh list` for the open Issues and Backlog lanes. It returns
gh-shaped JSON (number, title, labels) in all three tracker modes.

Match by judgment; when a title is ambiguous, read the body (`gh issue view N` in github mode,
`glab issue view N` in gitlab mode, `docs/issues/NNN-*.md` in local mode) before deciding.

A match is either the same work (covered) or the same area with a different ask (related, not a
duplicate). No match: proceed as new. How each skill renders and acts on a match is its own step
- this reference owns only the scan mechanism.
