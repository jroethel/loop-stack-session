# loop-molt: audit instruction prose against the live harness

Skills, manuals, and CLAUDE.md blocks rot silently: nothing fails when the harness absorbs a
mechanic, so the prose that describes it just becomes dead weight. Molt is the audit that catches
that drift - the third in the family next to /loop-improve (audits the product) and P10's evolve
move (audits the run logs). This skill runs on any prose-shaped artifact; loop-stack self-audit is
just the dogfood case.

The reference doc is `references/protocol.md` (vendored, canonical). Read it in full before
auditing - this SKILL.md is the thin wrapper, the protocol is the method.

## The one-line test

Per block of prose: **"would the harness or a current frontier model do this unprompted, today?"**
Not "is this correct?" - correct-but-native is still deletable. Prose describing HOW to do
mechanics is suspect; prose describing WHAT MUST BE TRUE is policy.

## The four bins

Every block sorts into one of four bins - **plumbing, policy, premise, choreography** - defined,
with their actions and the policy membership test, in `references/protocol.md` (step 3). This
SKILL.md never restates those definitions; the reference is their single home.

## Steps

Full procedure and rationale live in `references/protocol.md`; the pointers below are the running order, not a second copy.

0. **Refresh ground truth** - never audit against remembered capability; thin refresh (changelog + one live probe of a load-bearing claim) per artifact, deep refresh (full research pull) for a whole-stack recalibration. Date-stamp the snapshot - it is the evidence base and its expiry.
1. **Constraint register FIRST**`[gate:ASK]` - before classifying anything, ask the owner which design choices are deliberate standing constraints (portability, provider mix, cost, compliance) versus historical accident. Mandatory and ASK-class: never classify a premise as expired without it (a constraint misread as stale nearly flipped three recommendations); deliberate constraints are kept AND labeled so the next audit does not re-litigate them.
2. **Inventory** - break the artifact into blocks (each instruction, gate, step, or embedded claim is one unit); for a skill family, inventory duplication too (a narrative in N places counts once, then N-1 deletions).
3. **Classify** - sort every block into the four bins using the reference's definitions and policy-membership test; an expired premise is rewritten in place (never a bolted-on correction), a deliberate constraint kept and labeled.
4. **Test by subtraction** - delete the block, run the artifact's existing checks plus one real task, keep the deletion only if nothing degrades; a checkless artifact gets a check first (weaker fallback: compare one real task to a pre-deletion run).
5. **Emit the drift ledger line** - append one entry to `docs/molt-ledger.md` (`## YYYY-MM-DD - <artifact path>`: date, harness snapshot, blocks deleted by bin, blocks kept as policy, constraints re-confirmed); on a first audit of a principles-less artifact, also emit its derived invariants as a starter principles sheet.

## Workflow: inline vs. brief

- **Small findings** (block deletions, single-file rewrites) apply inline via the subtraction test
  with a `docs/molt-ledger.md` line, same session.
- **Structural findings** (skill merges, gates-to-hooks, re-homing) converge through the shared
  pipeline at `~/.claude/skills/loop-brainstorm/references/brief-pipeline.md` into a brief and ride
  the normal chain: /loop-plan -> /loop-drive -> /loop-review. No audit content is
  duplicated - loop-improve reaches this same audit via `--focus harness-drift`.

The artifact is harness-agnostic: this SKILL.md is the only Claude-Code-specific wrapper; the
protocol is portable prose that any agent can run.
