# Harness-Drift Audit (the "molt" protocol)

Vendored 2026-08-15 into skills/loop-molt from `~/create/pcs/harness-drift-audit-protocol.md`.
This copy is canonical; the pcs copy is the historical draft.

Distilled 2026-08-15 from the loop-stack-vs-research evaluation session.
Purpose: a repeatable workflow for re-evaluating any skill or prose instruction against what the harness now does natively, so plumbing gets deleted and policy survives.
Applies to: SKILL.md files, CLAUDE.md blocks, operating manuals, run-books - any instruction prose an agent consumes.

## The one-line test

Per block of prose, ask: "would the harness or a current frontier model do this unprompted, today?"
Not "is this correct?" - correct-but-native is still deletable.
Prose describing HOW to do mechanics is suspect; prose describing WHAT MUST BE TRUE is policy.

## When to run

- After any major harness release or model generation change.
- Before extending a skill (never add prose to un-audited prose).
- On a cadence otherwise (quarterly); the 90-day research shows the harness eats plumbing roughly monthly.

## Steps

### 0. Refresh ground truth (never audit against remembered capability)

The auditing session does its own pull, in two tiers:

- **Thin refresh (default, minutes):** changelog scan plus one live probe of any load-bearing feature claim (run the command in a scratch repo). Sufficient for a single artifact.
- **Deep refresh (occasional):** a full research pull (last30days or equivalent). Warranted for a whole-stack recalibration or a model-generation change, not per artifact.

Date-stamp the snapshot; it is the evidence base and its expiry. After the first audit, the drift ledger lets the next one diff from the last snapshot instead of re-researching from zero.

### 1. Constraint register FIRST (the C1 lesson)

Before classifying anything, ask the owner which design choices are deliberate standing constraints (portability, provider mix, cost, compliance) versus historical accident.
Never classify a premise as expired without this step; this session initially misread "/workflows off" as a stale premise when it was a live portability requirement, and the reversal changed three recommendations.

### 2. Inventory

Break the artifact into blocks: each instruction, gate, enumerated step, or embedded claim is one classifiable unit.
For a skill family, also inventory duplication (the same narrative stated in N places counts once, then N-1 deletions).

### 3. Classify every block into one of four bins

| Bin          | Definition                                          | Action                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| PLUMBING     | Mechanics the harness now performs unprompted       | Delete, or one pointer        |
| POLICY       | Discipline the harness will not impose on its own   | Keep; sharpen to outcomes     |
| PREMISE      | An assumption about the world or the harness        | Verify by a second route      |
| CHOREOGRAPHY | Step-by-step behavior a frontier model does by      | Delete via subtraction test   |
|              | judgment (probe names, question cadences)           |                               |

Premise sub-rule: expired premise gets rewritten in place (never a bolted-on correction); a deliberate constraint (from step 1) gets kept AND labeled as a constraint so the next audit does not re-litigate it.

POLICY membership test, with or without a principles sheet:
if the artifact has a principles sheet (like loop-stack's P1-P14), keep = traces to a named principle.
If it has none, derive as you go: for each block classified POLICY, write the one-line invariant it protects; a block whose broken-without-it invariant cannot be named is choreography in disguise.
The owner's constraint register seeds the invariant list; the first audit's byproduct is a starter principles sheet the next audit inherits.
A principles sheet is an accelerator, never a prerequisite.
Policy examples from the source session: checks-or-stall, validator-never-fixes contracts, per-unit cost routing tables, risk-classed gates, run-state formats, check custody.
Plumbing examples: fan-out mechanics, background execution, notifications, session resume - all prose re-describing what the harness already does.

### 4. Test by subtraction

Delete the block, run the artifact's existing checks plus one real task, keep the deletion if nothing degrades.
This requires the artifact to HAVE executable checks; an artifact with no checks gets a check before it gets an audit (loop-stack's gate tests are the model here).
Fallback for a checkless artifact: delete the block, run the artifact on one real task, compare output against a pre-deletion run - weaker certainty, still workable.
Per-line tiebreaker, from the research: "would removing this cause a mistake? If not, cut it."

### 5. Emit a drift ledger line (and, first time, a principles sheet)

Append to a small ledger (per artifact or per repo): date, harness snapshot version, blocks deleted by bin, blocks kept as policy, constraints re-confirmed.
On a first audit of a principles-less artifact, also emit the derived invariants as that artifact's starter principles sheet.
The next audit diffs from this known point instead of re-deriving everything.

## Expected steady state

Each audited artifact converges toward a policy sheet: constraints, contracts, thresholds, formats - riding on native mechanics.
Policy survives harness versions; plumbing has a shelf life of about one release cycle.
An artifact whose audit deletes nothing two cycles running is done molting; an artifact that only ever grows has never been audited.

## Where molt sits in the chain

Molt is the third audit in the family, next to /loop-improve and P10's evolve move, each on a different object: improve audits the product, molt audits the instruction prose, evolve audits the run logs. It exists because the other two never catch harness drift - nothing fails when the harness absorbs plumbing, so the prose silently becomes dead weight.

Small findings apply inline via the subtraction test with a drift ledger line, same session; structural findings (skill merges, gates-to-hooks, re-homing) emit a brief via the shared convergence machinery (brief-pipeline.md) and ride the normal chain: /loop-plan -> /loop-drive -> /loop-review. Self-targeting loop-stack is the dogfood case; molt runs on any prose-shaped artifact (manuals, CLAUDE.md blocks, other skills).

## Wiring it into the stack

One implementation, two entry points: the standalone `/loop-molt` skill owns the audit (this protocol as its reference), invocable directly on any artifact; `/loop-improve --focus harness-drift` delegates with a one-line pointer, never a second copy. Refresh (step 0) maps to a last30days/changelog pull; subtraction (step 4) maps to the artifact's existing test harness where one exists.
